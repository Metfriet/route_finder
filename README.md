Route generator
===============

This repo contains a RouteHelper module and an ThingToDo class used to generate a route. Test the code by running `test.rb`.

Install Ruby from http://rubyinstaller.org/. After installing Ruby, you'll need to run the commands `gem install chronic` and `gem install sparql-client` to install the libraries needed to run this code. 

I recommend the [RubyMine IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for editing. It has git integration and the full-featured version is free to use for 30 days. After 30 days, the program will automatically close after 30 minutes of use. It also has a very good debugger.
