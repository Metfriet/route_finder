Route generator
===============

This repo contains a RouteHelper module and an ThingToDo class used to generate a route.

I recommend the [RubyMine IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for editing. It has git integration and the full-featured version is free to use for 30 days. After 30 days, the program will automatically close after 30 minutes of use.
